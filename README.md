# Description of the assignment
I have made a POV UI of a futuristic robot that has landed on mars and has encountered aliens. This robot has a radar, warning system, alien analysis, capability to shoot, reload and loose health. This is somewhat based of the masterchief ui from Halo with my own twist to it.

# Instructions
1. Clicking anywhere on screen with left mouse click will shoot lasers.
2. Shooting at the aliens will cause them to agro on you and hit you back.
3. Once you use  up all of you bullets the system reloads them back for you (this may sabotage the radar system as reloading takes up    	all of your system effort)
4. Your health status bar is at the very top of the screen letting you know about your working status.
5. The radar lets the robot know the location of hostiles.
6. Hovering over the aliens will reveal information about them.
7. Once your health goes down to 0 your screen goes black and

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
